# Aim

The aim of this report is to analyze historical trends in the horse population
across Canada. By examining open government datasets and applying reproducible
data analysis techniques, we seek to identify key demographic shifts and inform
future agricultural policies [@ttimbers-horses].

# Data

Horse population data were sourced from the 
[Government of Canada's Open Data website](http://open.canada.ca/en/open-data) 
[@horses1; @horses2]

# Methods

The R programming language [@R] 
and the following R packages were used to perform the analysis: 
knitr [@knitr], tidyverse [@tidyverse], and Quarto [@Allaire_Quarto_2022]. 
*Note: this report is adapted from [@ttimbers-horses].*

# Results

![Horse populations for all provinces in Canada from 1906 - 1972.](../results/horse_pops_plot.png){#figure-horse}

We can see from @figure-horse that Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta 
have had the highest horse populations in Canada. 
All provinces have had a decline in horse populations since 1940. 
This is likely due to the rebound of the Canadian automotive industry 
after the Great Depression and the Second World War. 
An interesting follow-up visualisation would be car sales per year 
for each Province over the time period visualised above 
to further support this hypothesis.

Suppose we were interested in looking in more closely at the province 
with the highest spread (in terms of standard deviation) of horse populations. 
We present the standard deviations in @std-dev-table-horses.

Table 1. Standard deviation of historical (1906-1972) horse populations for each Canadian province.

```{r}
#| label: std-dev-table-horses
#| tbl-cap: Standard deviation of historical horse populations for each Canadian province between 1906 - 1972.
#| echo: false
horses_sd_table <- read_csv("../results/horses_sd.csv")
largest_sd <- horses_sd_table$Province[1]
knitr::kable(horses_sd_table)
```

Note that we define standard deviation (of a sample) as

$$s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \overline{x})^2}{N-1} }$$

Additionally, note that in @std-dev-table-horses we consider the sample standard deviation of the number of horses during the same time span as @figure-horse.

![For the province with the biggest standard deviation - the horse population](../results/horse_pop_plot_largest_sd.png){#horse-population-largest-std-dev width=65%}

In @horse-population-largest-std-dev we zoom in and look at the province of `{r} largest_sd` which had the largest spread of values in terms of standard deviation.
